        <b>Range</b><br>
        For the Taycan, even distant destinations are within easy reach.
        The Performance Battery Plus provides the Taycan with a WLTP range of up to 484 kilometres.
        Reducing the need to stop and charge, allowing you to cover long distances effortlessly. <br>
        </p>
        <p class = "whitesmoke">
        <b>800-volt architecture.</b><br>
        The Porsche soul stands for performance. 
        In every respect. As demonstrated by the Taycan, 
        even when charging: its 800-volt architecture produces 
        charge power of up to 270kW. 
        In five minutes, the Taycan Turbo, for example, 
        can be charged to enable a range of up to 100km (WLTP) 
        under optimum conditions¹ and is always ready for what 
        its driver spends the whole day dreaming about: driving.
        </p>
        <p class = "whitesmoke">
        <b>Drive concept.</b><br>
        The interaction of the drive components results in impressive performance figures, 
        both technically and emotionally: when up to 560kW (761PS) overboost is activated 
        with Launch Control, both motors accelerate the Taycan Turbo S from a standstill to 
        100km/h in 2.8 seconds. Allowing you to experience a standing start performance on a 
        par with that of a super sports car such as the 918 Spyder – that can be repeatedly 
        reproduced: consecutive acceleration is possible, up to a top speed of 260km/h.
        </p>
        <p class = "whitesmoke">
        <b>Dynamic flyline.</b><br>
        We instantly know what is good for our soul – and what inspires it.
        The Taycan reveals its fascination within fractions of a second: 
        with a fluid yet sharp silhouette and a dynamic flyline. Its rear design 
        boasts a seamless light strip and ‘PORSCHE’ logo made of three-dimensional 
        letters in a glass look. Seen enough? Definitely not.
        </p>
        <p class = "whitesmoke">
        <b>Porsche Advanced Cockpit.</b><br>
        We never forget the most breathtaking experiences of our life. 
        The Taycan interior is also impressive. The GT multifunction sports 
        steering wheel¹ and the deep, sporty seating position heighten your 
        anticipation of the journey ahead long before you set off. 
        The Porsche Advanced Cockpit with its innovative curved display also 
        focuses on state-of-the-art comfort – tailor-made for an electrifying 
        driving experience that will last forever.
